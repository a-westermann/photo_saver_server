# Goals:
    # Safe backup of photos
    # Free up space on pi
    # Easy retreival via phone? Maybe you run a command via ssh?

# Methods:
    # SFTP connect to server
    # Copy any new files to local storage
    # Unzip and then rezip the local archive w/ new photos added
    # Create the archives by year. e.g., photos from 2020 go in one archive, 2021 is a new one
    # Add a polled folder on the local machine that user can drop files into & it will transfer them to the server
        # This is to allow retreival via phone app

# Phase 2:
    # Delete photos on the pi older than x. They will exist on the local storage
    # Check server storage and delete files (oldest first) to get to x% available
